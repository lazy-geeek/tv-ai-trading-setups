• Examine all timeframes from the provided screeenshots.
• In all charts, there are visual graphical technical indicators to help you.
• Identify the overall market structure (uptrend, downtrend, or range) across these timeframes.
• Use the provided indicators in the charts.
• Identify important support/resistance levels, supply/demand zones, pivot points, Fibonacci retracements or extensions and psychological round numbers.
• Identify any emerging or established chart patterns (e.g., triangles, head & shoulders, harmonic patterns, etc).
• Include significant price action signals (pin bars, engulfing candles, dojis, etc) and what they might indicate about future movement.
• Assess underlying order blocks, supply/demand imbalances, or liquidity zones in the charts.
• Assess volume spikes or momentum shifts if applicable.
• Determine if there is any evidence of smart money concepts (e.g., stop hunts, institutional “fakeouts,” or springboard entries).
• Recommend a direction (long or short) with clear justification.
• Use pending orders at specific price levels (e.g., buy limit, sell stop).
• Stop-loss placement (exact level)
• Take-profit target (exact level)
• You must use an appropriate Risk/Reward ratio
• Use a reasonable safe stop loss for the trading setup.  
• Do not recommend a trading setup if the current market situation is unclear, you can not find a successful profitable setup or the risk reward ratio is not appropriate and respond why you could not find and propose a profitable setup - be honest.
