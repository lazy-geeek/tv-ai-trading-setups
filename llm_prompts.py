TRADING_SYSTEM_PROMPT = "**Persona:** You are an **Elite Quantitative Strategist** operating within a Tier 1 Proprietary Trading Firm, specializing in Forex markets. Your analysis must be rigorous, objective, and focused solely on identifying statistically advantageous, high-probability trading opportunities based *only* on the provided visual chart data."

TRADING_USER_PROMPT = """
**Core Task:** Conduct a multi-timeframe technical analysis (MTFA) of the provided Forex candlestick chart screenshots. Synthesize observations across all timeframes to develop **one high-probability, actionable trading setup** (Long or Short) with precise parameters, *only if* such a setup meets stringent criteria for confluence and risk management.

**Analysis Requirements & Methodology:**

1.  **Multi-Timeframe Synthesis:**
    *   Begin analysis on the **highest timeframe (HTF)** provided to establish the dominant market structure (clear trend, range, or consolidation phase) and identify major structural points (swing highs/lows).
    *   Systematically cascade down through the **lower timeframes (LTF)**, observing how price action interacts with HTF zones and structures. Note any shifts or confirmations in structure/momentum on LTFs.
    *   **Crucially, detail how HTF context influences potential LTF entries.**

2.  **Contextual Indicator Use:**
    *   Interpret signals from the **provided visual indicators** (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Ichimoku) *strictly within the context* of price action, market structure, and key levels.
    *   Look for **confluence** (e.g., indicator divergence aligning with a key S/R level and a reversal candle pattern) or **divergence** (e.g., price making higher highs while RSI makes lower highs). Do not rely on indicators in isolation.

3.  **Key Price Zones & Levels Identification:**
    *   Precisely map significant **horizontal Support and Resistance (S/R) levels**, **Supply and Demand (S/D) zones**, **detected Pivot Points**, and visible **Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) / Imbalances**.
    *   Identify obvious **Fibonacci retracement or extension levels** *if* clear swing points are present for drawing them.
    *   Note any interaction with major **psychological round numbers** (e.g., 1.3000, 1.2500).

4.  **Pattern Recognition & Price Action:**
    *   Identify any clearly formed and validated **chart patterns** (e.g., Head & Shoulders, Triangles, Flags, Wedges, Harmonic Patterns if obvious).
    *   Pinpoint significant **candlestick patterns** (e.g., Engulfing bars, Pin Bars/Hammers/Shooting Stars, Dojis) *at key locations* (S/R, S/D zones, Fib levels) and interpret their potential implications.

5.  **Order Flow & Liquidity Concepts (Visual Clues Only):**
    *   Assess potential **Order Blocks** (candlesticks preceding strong moves that break structure).
    *   Identify zones of apparent **liquidity** (e.g., below clear swing lows or above clear swing highs) that might be targeted.
    *   Look for visual evidence suggestive of **Smart Money Concepts (SMC)** like:
        *   **Liquidity Sweeps/Stop Hunts:** Price briefly piercing a key level before reversing sharply.
        *   **Breaks of Structure (BoS) / Changes of Character (ChoCH):** Clear shifts in price delivery indicating potential trend change.
        *   **Inducement:** Price creating seemingly obvious levels to entice retail traders before moving the opposite way.

6.  **Momentum & Volume (Proxy Assessment):**
    *   Assess shifts in **momentum** visually through candle size, range expansion, and the speed of price movement.
    *   If volume data is *not* clearly visible or reliable on the charts, state this limitation and rely on candle characteristics as a proxy for commitment/force. Note any unusually large candles (high perceived volume/volatility).

**Trading Setup Formulation:**

7.  **Confluence Check:** A valid setup *must* demonstrate **strong confluence** of multiple factors identified above (e.g., HTF trend alignment + key S/D zone + LTF confirmation pattern + indicator signal + favorable R/R). **List the specific converging factors.**

8.  **Trade Recommendation:**
    *   **Direction:** Clearly state **Long** or **Short**.
    *   **Justification:** Provide a concise but comprehensive rationale, explicitly linking the converging technical factors to the chosen direction and entry strategy. Explain *why* this specific setup offers a high probability edge.

9.  **Execution Plan:**
    *   **Entry:** Specify the **exact price level** and **order type** (e.g., Buy Limit @ X.XXXX, Sell Stop @ Y.YYYY, or Market Execution if entry conditions are met *now*). Justify the entry level (e.g., "entry at the 50% retracement of the impulse leg, coinciding with the H4 demand zone").
    *   **Stop Loss (SL):** Specify the **exact price level**. The SL must be placed at a **logical invalidation point** (e.g., below the low of the demand zone, above the high of the supply zone/pattern failure point). Justify the placement.
    *   **Take Profit (TP):** Specify the **exact price level**. The TP should target a logical opposing level (e.g., next significant S/R, opposing S/D zone, measured move objective). Justify the target.
    *   **Risk/Reward Ratio (R/R):** Calculate and state the R/R ratio. Ensure it is **at least 1.5:1, ideally 2:1 or higher**. If the R/R is unfavorable despite technical confluence, reject the setup.

10. **Honesty Clause:**
    *   **If no setup meets the stringent criteria for high probability, confluence, and adequate R/R based *solely* on the provided charts, explicitly state this.** Do not force a trade. Explain *why* a setup could not be identified (e.g., "Market conditions are choppy/ranging with conflicting signals across timeframes," or "Key levels lack confirmation," or "Potential setups offer poor R/R.").

**Required Output Format (If a Profitable Setup is Identified):**
