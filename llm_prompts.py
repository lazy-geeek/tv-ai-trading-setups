TRADING_USER_PROMPT = """
Analyze the provided forex candlestick charts as if you are an advanced quantitative strategist at a Tier 1 prop firm. Develop a high-probability trading setup using the following:

• Examine all timeframes from provided screeenshots.
• Identify the overall market structure (uptrend, downtrend, or range) across these timeframes.
• Use any relevant indicators or tools (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Ichimoku Cloud).
• Identify important support/resistance levels, supply/demand zones, pivot points, Fibonacci retracements or extensions and psychological round numbers.
• Note any emerging or established chart patterns (e.g., triangles, head & shoulders, harmonic patterns).
• Include significant price action signals (pin bars, engulfing candles, dojis) and what they might indicate about future movement.
• Assess underlying order blocks, supply/demand imbalances, or liquidity zones visible on the chart.
• Assess volume spikes or momentum shifts if applicable.
• Determine if there’s any evidence of smart money concepts (e.g., stop hunts, institutional “fakeouts,” or springboard entries).
• Recommend a direction (long or short) with clear justification.
• Use pending orders at specific price levels (e.g., buy limit, sell stop).
• Stop-loss placement (exact level or range), explained by key technical zones or volatility considerations.
• Take-profit target, justified by major support/resistance, Fibonacci levels or target the next liquidity pool
• The Risk/Reward ratio should at least be 1:2.

Example Output Format:

Instrument: GBPUSD 
Direction: Short
Entry: 1.2750 (break of 1H order block after liquidity sweep at 1.2780)
Stop Loss: 1.2810 (above daily swing high + 1.5x ATR)
Take Profit: 1.2650 (daily FVG fill + 1.618 Fib extension)

Don't recommend a trading setup if the current market situation is not clear enough or the desired risk reward ratio can not be fulfilled.
