“I have attached a screenshot of a forex pair candlestick chart. Please perform a comprehensive technical analysis and develop a high-probability trading plan. In your analysis, include:

MULTI-TIMEFRAME REVIEW
• Examine both higher (e.g., daily or 4H) and lower (e.g., 1H or 15M) timeframes.
• Identify the overall market structure (uptrend, downtrend, or range) across these timeframes.

TECHNICAL INDICATORS & PATTERNS
• Discuss any relevant indicators or tools (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Ichimoku Cloud).
• Mark important support/resistance levels, supply/demand zones, pivot points, Fibonacci retracements or extensions.
• Note any emerging or established chart patterns (e.g., triangles, head & shoulders, harmonic patterns).

CANDLESTICK & PRICE ACTION CLUES
• Highlight significant price action signals (pin bars, engulfing candles, dojis) and what they might indicate about future movement.
• Assess volume spikes or momentum shifts if applicable.

FUNDAMENTAL OR NEWS CONSIDERATIONS
• If relevant, mention any upcoming economic data releases or macro events that could impact this currency pair’s price action.

TRADE SETUP & EXECUTION PLAN
• Recommended direction (long or short) with clear justification.
• TWO possible entry methods:
1) Immediate/market entry.
2) Pending order(s) at specific price levels (e.g., buy limit, sell stop).
• Stop-loss placement (exact level or range), explained by key technical zones or volatility considerations.

“I have attached a screenshot of a forex pair candlestick chart. Please carry out an advanced, multifaceted analysis integrating technical, fundamental, and sentiment elements. Develop a strategic trading plan with clear risk management protocols. Here’s what I need you to cover in detail:

MARKET OVERVIEW & MACRO CONTEXT
• Evaluate the broader market environment relevant to this currency pair.
• Discuss any major economic releases, central bank policies, or geopolitics that could impact price action.
• Incorporate possible correlations with commodities, equities, or other currency pairs if relevant.

MULTI-TIMEFRAME TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
• Examine higher timeframes (weekly/daily/4H) and lower intraday timeframes (1H, 30M, 15M).
• Describe the prevailing trend on each timeframe (bullish, bearish, ranging).
• Map out core support/resistance zones, trendlines, key fib levels, and psychological round numbers.
• Highlight any advanced price action or pattern setups (head & shoulders, Wolfe waves, harmonic patterns like Gartley, Bat, Crab, etc.).

INDICATORS & CONFIRMATION TOOLS
• Discuss the use of advanced indicators (Ichimoku Cloud, Volume Profile, RSI divergences, MACD crossovers, ATR for volatility).
• Note how these indicators confirm or contradict the overall price action story.
• If applicable, analyze order flow, depth of market, or volume spikes to identify potential liquidity pockets or trap areas.

CANDLESTICK PATTERNS & ORDER FLOW
• Pinpoint specific candlestick formations (fractals, dojis, engulfing bars, pin bars) and interpret their significance.
• Assess underlying order blocks, supply/demand imbalances, or liquidity zones visible on the chart.
• Determine if there’s any evidence of smart money concepts (e.g., stop hunts, institutional “fakeouts,” or springboard entries).

SENTIMENT & POSITIONING
• If possible, incorporate sentiment analysis from COT reports or retail trader positioning tools.
• Discuss how extreme sentiment might provide contrarian opportunities.

PRIMARY & ALTERNATE TRADE SETUPS
• Propose a preferred trading bias (long or short) with multiple justifications from the technical and fundamental viewpoint.
• Provide up to three entry methods:
1) Aggressive entry (market order).
2) Conservative entry (pending order at a key level).
3) Breakout or pullback entry strategy.
• For each entry, specify precise conditions and triggers (e.g., price break above certain resistance, close confirmation on the 1H chart, etc.).

STOP-LOSS & TAKE-PROFIT STRATEGY
• Outline logical stop-loss placements (e.g., beyond a swing high/low, ATR-based, or behind a key demand zone).
• Present at least two-tiered take-profit targets (TP1, TP2), explaining the rationale (near major S/R, Fibonacci extension, pivot zones, or previous highs/lows).
• Discuss position scaling, partial closing, or trailing stop tactics to protect gains.

RISK MANAGEMENT & MONEY MANAGEMENT
• Propose a recommended risk per trade (e.g., 1-2% of account balance).
• Provide examples of how to size the position to maintain an optimal risk/reward ratio.
• Discuss how to adjust stops or reduce exposure in high-volatility events (e.g., news releases or market opens).

SCENARIO PLANNING & ALTERNATE OUTCOMES
• Clearly define an invalidation level or condition (e.g., the break of a major trendline) if the thesis fails.
• Offer both a bullish and a bearish scenario, detailing the catalysts that would shift market bias.
• Explain what to do if price becomes choppy or stuck in a no-trade zone (e.g., wait for clearer signals, switch timeframes, or remain on the sidelines).

TRADING TIMEFRAME & MONITORING
• Indicate whether this trade is intended as a short-term scalp, intraday setup, swing trade, or longer-term position.
• Recommend how frequently the chart should be revisited to confirm or refine the trade thesis (e.g., every 4 hours for a swing trade, every 15 minutes for scalping, etc.).

FINAL SUMMARY & ACTIONABLE STEPS
• Summarize the recommended trade in a concise bulleted list (bias, key entry points, stop-loss, take-profit, risk parameters).
• Include any cautionary notes about big events on the economic calendar, liquidity concerns, or overnight holding risks.
• Emphasize that this plan is an idea, not a guarantee, and that I should cross-check or backtest before committing capital.

Important Reminders:
• This trading plan is for informational and educational purposes only. I will assume full responsibility for my own trading decisions.
• Please be as specific as possible regarding price levels, risk parameters, and trade logic so I can implement the strategy on my broker’s platform effectively.
• If additional data or chart analyses would enhance the proposal, include them or mention the reasoning.

Deepseek Level 1
****************************

"Analyze this forex candlestick chart screenshot. Identify:

Key Price Patterns (e.g., pin bars, engulfing candles, double tops/bottoms).

Support/Resistance Levels (horizontal or trendline-based).

Trend Direction (higher highs/lows = uptrend, lower highs/lows = downtrend).

Technical Indicators (if visible: RSI, MACD, moving averages, etc.).

Based on these observations, propose a trading setup with:

Entry Price (e.g., breakout level, pullback to support/resistance).

Stop Loss (logical level where the setup is invalidated).

Take Profit (target based on risk-reward ratio ≥ 1:2).

Trade Bias (long/short) and time frame (e.g., 1H, 4H).

Confidence Level (low/medium/high) based on confluence of factors.

Include a brief rationale for each decision."

Important Notes:

LLM Limitations: LLMs lack real-time data, emotional context, and market depth analysis. Always validate setups with your own strategy.

Risk Disclaimer: Never risk more than 1-2% of your account per trade.

Broker Compatibility: Ensure your broker supports the suggested order types (e.g., stop-loss limits).

Example of a possible response format:

Setup: EURUSD 4H Short
Entry: 1.0850 (break below rising wedge)
Stop Loss: 1.0890 (above recent swing high)
Take Profit: 1.0750 (1:2.5 RR)
Confidence: Medium (bearish divergence on RSI + structure break).


****************************************
Deepseek Level 2
****************************************

Analyze the attached forex candlestick chart screenshot and provide a detailed trading plan using the following framework:

1. Market Structure & Higher-Timeframe Context
Identify the primary trend (daily/weekly) and current market phase (accumulation, markup, distribution, markdown).

Mark key swing points (highs/lows) and determine if price is in an impulsive or corrective wave.

Highlight institutional liquidity zones (equal highs/lows, stop hunts, volume clusters).

2. Multi-Timeframe Confluence
Analyze alignment across 3 timeframes (e.g., 1H for entry, 4H for bias, daily for trend).

Note divergences on momentum indicators (RSI, MACD) across these timeframes.

3. Advanced Price Action
Identify harmonic patterns (e.g., Bat, Cypher), breaker blocks, or order blocks from prior price reactions.

Look for candle clusters at key levels (e.g., 3 pushes to a level, exhaustion wicks).

Assess volume profile (if visible) for high-volume nodes or low-volume gaps.

4. Precision Entry & Risk Management
Define entry triggers:

Break of a mitigation block or liquidity sweep.

Retest of a reversal candle (e.g., bullish/bearish breaker) with volume confirmation.

Stop Loss: Place beyond a liquidity void or structural level (e.g., 1% beyond swing high/low).

Take Profit: Use a Fibonacci extension (e.g., 1.618x risk) or target the next liquidity pool.

Calculate position size using the ATR (Average True Range) for volatility-adjusted risk.

5. Sentiment & Catalyst Alignment
Note any upcoming economic events (e.g., NFP, CPI) that could invalidate the setup.

Check alignment with intermarket correlations (e.g., DXY for USD pairs, oil for CAD/JPY).

6. Trade Thesis & Validation
Provide a probability score (1-5) based on confluence:

5: Multi-timeframe trend + liquidity grab + momentum divergence + institutional pattern.

1: Single timeframe, no volume/structural confirmation.

Suggest a backtest rule (e.g., "Only take this setup if 70% of prior instances hit 1:2 RR").

Example Output Format
Instrument: GBPUSD 1H (aligned with 4H bearish, daily range)
Bias: Short
Entry: 1.2750 (break of 1H order block after liquidity sweep at 1.2780)
Stop Loss: 1.2810 (above daily swing high + 1.5x ATR)
Take Profit: 1.2650 (daily FVG fill + 1.618 Fib extension)
Confluence:

Bearish 4H RSI divergence + 1H hidden divergence.

Sweep of liquidity above 1.2780 (stop hunt) into 1H bearish breaker candle.

Daily trendline resistance holds.
Probability Score: 4/5 (lacks weekly alignment).
Post-Trade Plan: Reduce 50% at 1:2 RR, trail stop to breakeven.

"Analyze the provided forex candlestick chart as if you are a quantitative strategist at a Tier 1 prop firm. Generate a trading plan using the following protocol:

A. Fractal Market Theory & Macro Context
Identify the dominant fractal timeframe (e.g., weekly chart’s impulse wave) and its phase transition thresholds (e.g., 0.618 Fib retracement of the monthly range).

Map dark pool liquidity zones (clusters of prior failed breakouts/breakdowns) and Gamma levels (if synthetic volatility data is inferrable).

Align with macro narratives (e.g., Fed policy cycles, CFTC COT report positioning extremes).

B. Machine Learning-Driven Pattern Recognition
Detect non-linear chart patterns (e.g., convolutional neural network-identified hidden harmonics, Wolfe Waves, or VPIN density anomalies).

Flag statistical edges using probabilistic frameworks:

Bayesian posterior probability of a bullish/bearish resolution based on historical analogs.

Monte Carlo simulations for risk-of-ruin at the proposed stop level.

Quantify market regime (momentum/mean-reversion) via entropy analysis of candle volatility clusters.

C. Order Flow & Auction Market Theory
Identify unfinished auctions (price levels where time/price失衡 occurred).

Mark composite profiles:

Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) deviations.

Delta imbalance (aggressive buyer/seller dominance at key nodes).

Highlight liquidity voids (zones with minimal historical transactional activity).

D. Adaptive Risk Framework
Dynamic Position Sizing: Use Kelly Criterion based on win-rate and risk-reward of the setup.

Stop Loss Logic:

Place beyond a liquidity trigger (e.g., 99th percentile volatility spike of the past 24H).

Adjust for fat-tail risk using Extreme Value Theory (EVT).

Profit-Taking:

Tiered exits at VPOC (Volume Point of Control) and forward-pricing gaps.

Trail using a recursive volatility filter (e.g., Chandelier Exit with ATR decay).

E. Sentiment Alpha & Alternative Data
Gauge retail crowd bias via options skew (if synthetic data is derivable) or social media scrapes.

Cross-validate with institutional footprint:

E-mini S&P correlations for risk-on/-off bias.

Intermarket divergences (e.g., gold/JPY as a safe-haven proxy).

F. Backtest Protocol
Assign a Z-Score quantifying statistical significance of the setup (e.g., Z > 2.5 = high confidence).

Provide a regime-adjusted win rate (e.g., "82% profitable in bearish volatility regimes since 2020").

Stress-test against black swan catalysts (e.g., geopolitical flashpoints, central bank interventions).

G. Execution Plan
Entry Types:

Aggressive: Fade liquidity grab at inverse CME gap fill.

Conservative: Wait for NY/London overlap volume surge + 5-minute closing confirmation.

Time Decay Hedge: Pair with a reverse option structure (e.g., long OTM put as tail-risk insurance).

Example Output Format
Instrument: USDJPY (Aligned with Monthly Impulsive Wave 3)
Thesis: Short into Q4 BOJ Policy Pivot Hedge
Entry: 148.90 (Break of 4H VWAP + Weekly Order Block After Gamma Flip at 149.50)
Stop Loss: 150.20 (Beyond 99.7% EVT Volatility Band + Pre-2022 Intervention High)
Take Profit:

TP1: 146.30 (Monthly VWAP Anchor) → 40% Position

TP2: 144.80 (0.786 Fib of 2023 Rally + VPOC) → 60% Position
Confluence:

Quant: Z-Score 3.1 (Top 5% of 10Y Analog Setups) | Bayesian Win Probability 68%.

Flow: Aggressive seller delta at 149.20 (10:1 vs. buyers) + Dark Pool Liquidity Drain.

Regime: Entropy Shift to Mean-Reversion (95% Confidence via HMM).
Risk: 0.75% Max Drawdown | Kelly Size: 2.3% of Portfolio.
Tail Hedge: Long 1M 151.00 Call (1:5 Risk Offset).

"Analyze this Forex candlestick chart screenshot, focusing on identifying high-probability trading setups. Specifically, look for setups where multiple factors converge (confluence) to suggest a potential trade. Consider:

Currency Pair and Timeframe: (Confirm/identify)

Multi-Timeframe Analysis: Analyze the trend and key levels on [Higher Timeframe, e.g., 4H if screenshot is 1H, or Daily if screenshot is 4H] to provide context for the setup on the chart.

Confluence Factors: Identify at least 3 of the following that support a potential setup:

Trend Alignment: Is the setup in line with the higher timeframe trend?

Key Support/Resistance Rejection/Break: Is price reacting to a significant level?

Candlestick Pattern Confluence: Is a candlestick pattern forming at a key level or in line with momentum?

Moving Average Confluence: Are moving averages providing dynamic support/resistance? (If visible)

Indicator Divergence/Confirmation: (If indicators are visible - specify which ones you are interested in, e.g., RSI, MACD divergence)

Volatility Contraction/Expansion: Is volatility contracting suggesting a potential breakout? (Inferable from candlestick ranges)

Trading Setup Details:

Direction (Buy/Sell) and Probability Assessment: Rate the perceived probability of success of this setup by the LLM (e.g., Low, Medium, High based on confluence). Explain the reasoning.

Entry Trigger (Specific and Actionable): Instead of just "price level," ask for a specific trigger, e.g., "Enter on a break and close above [price level] on the [timeframe] chart," or "Enter on a pullback to [price level] after a specific candlestick confirmation."

Stop Loss Placement (Volatility-Based): "Place stop loss [X pips/percentage] below the recent swing low/high OR below [specific candlestick pattern low/high]." Ask for guidance on a dynamic stop loss based on chart volatility.

Take Profit Strategy (Multiple Targets or Trailing Stop Consideration): "Suggest a primary Take Profit target based on [resistance level, Fibonacci extension, etc.] and a secondary Take Profit target OR advise on using a trailing stop to maximize potential profit if the trend continues."

Risk Assessment & Invalidation:

Key Risk Factors: What are the main risks associated with this setup?

Invalidation Point: At what price level would this setup likely be invalidated and no longer be valid?

Disclaimer: (As before, but even more emphasized).

Option 2.2: Targeting Specific Trading Styles with Advanced Techniques:

"I'm interested in a [Breakout / Reversal / Trend-Following / Range-Bound - choose one] trading setup on this Forex candlestick chart screenshot. Please analyze it using techniques relevant to [your chosen trading style] and provide a potential trading setup.

Currency Pair and Timeframe

Analysis Techniques Specific to [Chosen Style]:
* Breakout: Analyze for consolidation patterns, volume clues (if visible or inferable), potential catalysts (if any are implied by the chart pattern), and key breakout levels.
* Reversal: Analyze for exhaustion patterns (candlestick patterns, divergence), strong support/resistance zones, potential trend exhaustion signals.
* Trend-Following: Analyze for clear trend structure (higher highs/lows or lower highs/lows), pullbacks to moving averages or trendlines, momentum indicators confirming the trend.
* Range-Bound: Analyze for clear horizontal support and resistance levels, candlestick patterns confirming range boundaries, oscillator readings (e.g., RSI, Stochastic) within range parameters.

Trading Setup Details: (Similar to Option 2.1, but tailored to the chosen style - e.g., for breakout, focus on entry after confirmation, for reversal, focus on early entry with tighter stop).

Rationale Tailored to [Chosen Style]

Risk/Reward Ratio (refined for the chosen style): E.g., for breakouts, consider a tighter stop and higher potential reward; for reversals, risk may be higher initially.

Confirmation Signals (more specific): E.g., for breakouts, "confirmation should be a strong impulsive candle closing above the breakout level with increased volume (if visible)."

Psychological Considerations (briefly): For example, "Be aware that breakout trades can have false breakouts, manage risk accordingly."

************************************
Gemini Level 3
************************************

"Assume the role of a highly experienced Forex trading analyst assisting a professional trader. Your task is to analyze the attached candlestick chart screenshot and provide a comprehensive trading setup proposal. Go beyond simple pattern recognition and focus on identifying a statistically probable edge within this specific market context. Your analysis should be structured as follows:

1. Executive Summary: Setup Overview & Edge Hypothesis

Briefly state the proposed trading setup (Direction, Pair, Timeframe).

Articulate the core hypothesis for the edge: What market inefficiency or predictable behavior are you attempting to exploit with this setup? Explain the reasoning behind why this setup might have a higher probability of success than a random trade, based solely on the information visible in the chart and typical market dynamics. (Think in terms of: Trend continuation strength, Reversal from key level with exhaustion, Breakout momentum after consolidation, etc.)

2. Multi-Dimensional Chart Analysis:

Timeframe Context: Analyze the trend and key levels on [Higher Timeframe, e.g., Daily if screenshot is 4H, Weekly if screenshot is Daily] to establish broader market context and directional bias. How does the setup on the screenshot timeframe align with or contradict the higher timeframe picture?

Price Action Deep Dive: Detailed analysis of recent price action leading to the potential setup. Identify significant swing highs/lows, momentum shifts, and volatility patterns. Are there signs of accumulation/distribution? Is price exhibiting impulsive or corrective behavior?

Volume Analysis (If Volume Data is Visually Discernible or Implied): Infer volume clues from candlestick size and range. Is there volume confirmation of price movements? Are there volume divergences suggesting potential weakness? (If your chart includes volume indicators, explicitly mention them and ask for their analysis)

Volatility Regime Assessment: Is the market currently in a high, low, or trending volatility regime (infer from candlestick ranges and chart structure)? How does the current volatility regime impact the proposed setup and risk management?

Potential Catalysts (Inferred from Chart): Are there any chart patterns (e.g., flags, wedges) that might suggest an impending breakout or significant move driven by underlying market forces (even if not explicitly news-related)? Recognize that you cannot know actual news, but infer potential market anticipation from price action.

3. Quantifiable Trading Plan:

Precise Entry Trigger & Logic: Define a specific and actionable entry trigger (e.g., "Buy Stop order at [price] triggered by a close above [level] with confirmation from [candlestick pattern/indicator]"). Explain the logic behind this specific trigger – why is this the optimal entry point?

Dynamic Stop Loss Strategy & Rationale: Instead of a fixed pip stop, propose a dynamic stop loss strategy. Consider: "Initial Stop Loss at [price level] OR [X% of Average True Range (ATR) below entry] OR [below recent swing low]. How should the stop loss be adjusted as the trade progresses favorably or unfavorably? Consider using trailing stops or adjusting based on market structure. Explain the rationale for the chosen stop loss placement in terms of risk management and setup invalidation.

Multi-Target Take Profit Strategy & Justification: Outline a multi-target take profit strategy. Target 1 at [price level - based on immediate resistance/risk-reward]. Target 2 at [price level - based on projected move/Fibonacci extension/previous swing high]. Justify each target based on chart analysis and potential reward. Also, consider the possibility of scaling out positions and running a portion of the trade longer.

Estimated Risk/Reward Ratio (for each target): Calculate the estimated risk/reward ratio for each take profit target based on the defined entry and stop loss. Is the overall risk/reward profile attractive for this type of setup and market conditions?

Position Sizing Considerations (Qualitative Guidance): Provide qualitative guidance on position sizing. Considering the perceived probability of success (from your edge hypothesis) and the defined risk, should this be a [smaller/standard/larger] position size relative to a typical trade? Acknowledge that actual position sizing depends on individual risk tolerance and account size, but offer relative guidance based on the setup's characteristics.

4. Risk Management & Contingency Planning:

Maximum Potential Drawdown (Estimate): Based on your analysis and stop loss strategy, what is the maximum potential drawdown (in pips and percentage terms) for this trade if the setup fails completely?

Key Invalidation Levels: Identify specific price levels that, if breached, would invalidate the trading setup and signal that the initial edge hypothesis is likely incorrect. What price action would signal that the setup is no longer valid?

Contingency Plan (If Setup Fails): If the trade moves against you and hits the stop loss, what is the next course of action? Re-analyze the chart? Look for a different setup in the opposite direction? Step aside and wait for better opportunities?

External Risk Factors (Acknowledge Limitations): Acknowledge that this analysis is based solely on the chart. Real-world trading involves external risks (news events, black swans, broker issues, etc.) that are not visible on the chart. Emphasize the need for awareness of broader market context and risk management beyond chart analysis.

5. Probability & Confidence Assessment:

Qualitative Probability Score: On a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being very low, 10 being very high), what is your qualitative assessment of the probability of this setup being profitable based on your analysis and edge hypothesis? Explain your reasoning for this score.

Confidence Level in Analysis: How confident are you in your analysis and the proposed trading plan? (Low, Medium, High). Acknowledge any limitations in your analysis or areas of uncertainty.

6. Disclaimer & Trader Responsibility:

Explicit Disclaimer: THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. THIS ANALYSIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. FOREX TRADING IS HIGHLY RISKY AND YOU CAN LOSE MONEY. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR TRADING DECISIONS.

Emphasis on Due Diligence: Reiterate that the trader must conduct their own independent analysis, backtesting, demo trading, and risk assessment before considering any real trades. This LLM analysis is just one input in their overall trading process.

Important Instructions for the LLM:

Base your analysis exclusively on the visual information in the attached screenshot and your general knowledge of Forex market dynamics and technical analysis principles. Do not access external websites, real-time data, or news feeds.

Be as specific and actionable as possible in your trading plan. Vague or general advice is not helpful.

Prioritize risk management in your analysis and recommendations.

Be realistic about the limitations of chart-based analysis and the inherent risks of Forex trading.

Clearly differentiate between factual observations from the chart and probabilistic interpretations or hypotheses.
